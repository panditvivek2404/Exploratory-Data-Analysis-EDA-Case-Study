Recently, I worked on an interesting dataset related to individuals and their insurance charges. The dataset included attributes like:
➡️ Age, Sex, BMI, Children
➡️ Smoker status, Claim amount, Past consultations
➡️ Daily steps, Hospital expenditure
➡️ Past hospitalizations, Annual salary

Here’s a quick summary of the insights:

✅ Handled missing values (less than 30%) by dropping rows.
✅ No duplicate records were found.
✅ Outliers in numerical columns were treated using the IQR method.
✅ Slightly higher proportion of females (54.2%) compared to males (45.8%).
✅ Average annual salary is fairly consistent across regions.
✅ Smokers vs. Non-smokers: BMI range is wider for non-smokers.
✅ A strong positive linear relationship exists between annual salary and insurance charges.

✨ This analysis provided a strong foundation to understand the dataset and identify meaningful relationships between features.

📊 Next steps: I plan to dive deeper into predictive modeling to see how well these features can explain or predict insurance charges.
